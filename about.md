Hi! My name is Dian Chen. I am a freshman studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I am from [Wuhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan), a beautiful city located in the middle part of China. In my free time, I like reading, wathcing Anime and boxing, and playing basketball. I also like to play the guitar, and playing video games.
