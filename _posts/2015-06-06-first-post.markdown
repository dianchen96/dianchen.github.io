Hello World! This is the first post of my blog. I have decided to start this blog because I found I really need a place to post thoughts and ideas that come up with my mind recently. Here, I will try to blog about technologies, ideas, and maybe some ponderings about my life so far.

This blog(or site) is built with [Jekyll][jekyll], a static blog generator, whose repo can be found [here][jekyll-gh]. I think it is a very good tool for blogging, as it generates all the pages for you and allows you to blog in Markdown, which is very handy. It even supports Pygments, allowing you to do code highlighting, like this:
{% highlight python %}
_='_=%r;print(_%%_)';print(_%_)
{% endhighlight %}
